Using the Pokémon Unity framework, The Zapata Region is a project based on building an entire region in Pokémon Unity. The region is based around rural Mexico and is still in its early stages of development. The starters have been designed and so far the beginning of the player's story is being both written and programmed in-game. If you'd like to be apart of this project, be sure to check out the Discord! 


This project is built around Pokémon Unity's legacy code, it is not recommended to build off of this fork as a starting point. Try helping out with Pokémon Unity's new beta framework instead.
